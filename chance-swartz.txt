Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An inline element only affects content within that line, or the space it takes up. Whereas a block element will take up the entire screens worth of space it wants. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        It will not be shifted, or moved.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
